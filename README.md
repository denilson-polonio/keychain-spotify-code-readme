## Keychain / Spotify Code

**Introduction**
In this guide, we will show you how to create a Spotify tag with Tinkercad. To do this, you will need:

Required:
* A [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) Account.
* Know the basics of a vector graphics program such as [Adobe Illustrator: PAID](https://www.adobe.com/it/products/illustrator.html) or [inkscape: FREE](https://inkscape. org/release).
* A link to a song, album, playlist, or artist on Spotify


**Part 1:**

1. Open [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/8rgx9zWSMcN?sharecode=LkHbbkmANtvtzAyHInHhswWZ7F1XJn0p6cH9i1ZOKFY), create an account and clone the project.
2. Download a vector graphics program ([Adobe Illustrator : PAID](https://www.adobe.com/it/products/illustrator.html) or [inkscape: FREE](https://inkscape.org/release)).
3. Open [Spotify Codes](https://spotifycodes.com/) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/).

**Part 2:**

1. Copy the link of a song/album/playlist or artist from [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/) and paste it to [Spotify Codes](https://spotifycodes.com/) and at the end click the download button.
2. Bring the file you just downloaded (jpeg/png/svg) to your vector graphics program ([Adobe Illustrator : PAID](https://www.adobe.com/it/products/illustrator.html) or [inkscape: FREE](https://inkscape.org/release)) and transform it into vector, as in the example and eliminate the spotify logo.
3. Save the file in .svg format and import it into the project you cloned before (Part 1:1).

**Part 3:**

1. On Tinkercad set your spotify code as empty, resize it, adapt it, center it above the black plate and join the 2 parts as in the example.
2. Continue to [Part 4] if you also want to do the back of the tag, otherwise eliminate the white tag and continue to [Part 5].

**Part 4 (Optional):**

1. Create in your vector graphics program ([Adobe Illustrator : PAID](https://www.adobe.com/it/products/illustrator.html) or [inkscape: FREE](https://inkscape.org/release)) a graphic to apply behind the key ring, save the file as .svg and import it into Tinkercad.
2. Resize and fit the graphic on the white sign and merge it.

**Part 5:**

1. Save your Tinkercad project to stl/obg... and print it.
2. Change the colors for each tag as indicated on the project.
3. Fit the pieces together and glue them, with a glue suitable for the material you used to print.

**Good Job!**
